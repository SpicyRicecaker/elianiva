# Hi there! üëã

I'm Elianiva, or if you prefer to call me with my real name, Dicha (though technically my username **IS** part of my realname). I'm a 16 y/o boi doing some random web/loonix related stuff. Here's a summary about me.

- :seedling: I‚Äôm currently learning React, Node, TS, Lua, Svelte, Routify, and UI/UX.
- :earth_asia: Native Indonesian speaker and fluent English. Currently learning Japanese.
- :question: Ask me about anything and I'll answer it if I can. Just feel free to hit me up :)
- :mailbox: How to reach me: Just email me, it's the best way to reach me.
- :smile: Pronouns: Dia / He / ÂΩº
- :zap: Fun fact: I freakin love Babymetal. My favourite song from them is ‰∏ä‰∏ãÂ∑¶Âè≥BBAB and Elevator Girl (JP ver).
